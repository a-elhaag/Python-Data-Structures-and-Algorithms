# Python Data Structures & Algorithms

Welcome to the **Python Data Structures & Algorithms** repository! This is where I upload all the codes I write during my studies of the [Udemy course on Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-python/).

## 📝 Course Overview

This course is a deep dive into data structures and algorithms using Python. It covers fundamental concepts and includes hands-on exercises to reinforce learning. I'll be solving a variety of problems, including LEETCODE exercises, and organizing them into two main directories: **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**.

### 🚀 Get Started

To get started with this repository, follow the instructions below.

#### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Python-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms.git
cd Python-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

You might want to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Run the following commands:

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Run the code

You can run the individual Python scripts directly. For example:

```sh
python Data_Structures/linked_list.py
python Algorithms/sorting.py
```
